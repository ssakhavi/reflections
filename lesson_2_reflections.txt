What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Basically it is to say that you want to control versions of the repository on 
your computer. it makes a .\git folder which has the commits inside




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

You can determine how you actually want the order of the commits and the bundle 
of commits to be when you are trying change several files as once
