## When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Whenever you want to access the repository from somewhere other than the local machine or there is a collaborator

## Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So if you make a mistake it doesn't interfere with the original code.


#What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is good to look at progress
